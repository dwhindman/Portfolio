         <h3>Welcome!<h3>
           <p>
           Thank you so much for visiting my page! My name is David Hindman
           and I am a proud husband and father of two children. In my free time I like to build models, 
             work on puzzles of any type, and spend time with my family. I am currently residing just
           north of Orlando in DeBary, Florida.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
     
             <p>As a puzzle enthusiast and problem solver, I have found great satisfaction in web development.
              Finding creative solutions to problems where others may give up. As a teacher, I bring my desire to
              help others solve their problems creatively as well.</p>
